## Description

_{This application was built with the emphasis on the back end server. We created a database with a collection of breeds, dogs, matches (between dog seeker and dog provider), and users. Our app offers the ability to query and aggregate dog information for potential buyers or sellers. Specifically, it allows users to find out how many dogs are in their area by zip code search, cost, dog personality traits, and much more.....
